SmartMiles: A Safer, Greener, Smarter Commute Optimizer
**Inspiration**
The inspiration for Smart Miles stems from a vision of creating a more sustainable and efficient transportation solution. With a focus on environmental consciousness and community collaboration, we aim to revolutionize daily commuting by fostering a culture of shared rides and eco-friendly travel.

**What it does**
Smart Miles is a cutting-edge carpooling platform that seamlessly connects drivers and passengers with a shared commitment to greener, smarter travel. Through an intuitive web application built with ReactJS and Spring Boot, users can effortlessly coordinate rides, promoting resource efficiency and reducing carbon footprints.

**How we built it**
Smart Miles was crafted with a tech stack designed for versatility and scalability. Leveraging ReactJS for a dynamic frontend and Spring Boot for a robust backend, our team employed AWS services (EKS, ECR, Certificate Manager, Route 53) for cloud infrastructure. Docker containers ensure consistent deployment across diverse environments, forming a cohesive and resilient solution.
